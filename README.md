GitHub ETL Project Readme
This project is a demonstration of an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process using the GitHub API. ETL is vital for gathering, refining, and storing data for analysis. Here, we fetch repository information from GitHub, refine it into a structured form, and then load it into an SQLite database.

Overview of the ETL Process
1. Extraction
We use the GitHub API to extract details about repositories belonging to a specified user.

2. Transformation
We refine the extracted data into a structured format, focusing on attributes like repository name, description, and URL, which align with our project's goals.

3. Loading
The transformed data is loaded into an SQLite database for storage.

Structure of the Project
extract.py: Contains functions for fetching data from the GitHub API.
transform.py: Holds functions for refining raw data into a structured format.
load.py: Implements the loading of data into the SQLite database.
github_repos.db: An SQLite database for storing repository information.
README.md: Documentation for the project.
Instructions
Set your GitHub username in the github_username variable found in main.py.
Run main.py to execute the ETL process.
Verify successful execution by inspecting the SQLite database or running queries.
Usage
Installation
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the ETL Process
bash
Copy code
python main.py
Database Inspection
Utilize SQLite browser software or execute SQL queries to examine the github_repos.db database.

Conclusion
This GitHub API-based ETL project provides a foundational framework for scalable and maintainable data processing systems. There is room for improvement, such as handling error cases, enhancing security measures, and refining user experience. This project serves as a starting point for addressing evolving requirements in data extraction, transformation, and loading.

We welcome contributions, expansions, and customizations to suit diverse needs. Your feedback and suggestions are invaluable!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
