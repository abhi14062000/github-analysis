#GitHub ETL Project

This project aims to demonstrate an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process using the GitHub API. ETL is crucial for collecting, cleaning, and storing data for effective analysis. In this project, we extract repository information from GitHub, transform it into a structured format, and load it into an SQLite database.

#ETL Process Overview
1. Data Extraction
We utilize the GitHub API to extract repository details for a specified user.

2. Data Transformation
Selected attributes such as repository name, description, and URL are transformed into a structured format, aligning with project objectives.

3. Data Loading
The transformed data is loaded into an SQLite database for storage.

#Project Structure
extract.py: Contains functions for data extraction from the GitHub API.
transform.py: Includes functions for transforming raw data into a structured format.
load.py: Implements data loading into the SQLite database.
github_repos.db: SQLite database to store repository information.
README.md: Documentation for the project.
# Instructions
Set up your GitHub username in github_username variable in main.py.
Run main.py to execute the ETL process.
Verify the successful execution by checking the SQLite database or running queries.
Usage
Installation
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run ETL Process
python main.py
Check Database
Use SQLite browser or run SQL queries to inspect the github_repos.db database.

#Conclusion
The GitHub API-based ETL project provides a foundation for scalable and maintainable data processing systems. Further enhancements can be made to handle error cases, improve security, and enhance user experience. This project serves as a starting point for addressing evolving requirements in data extraction, transformation, and loading.
